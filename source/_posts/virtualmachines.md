In this opportunity I come to teach how to configure a virtual machine in azure, as I have commented in several posts it is important to have an azure account https://portal.azure.com/, when we are in the azure portal we go to the option of virtual machines and we give you the option to add

 When we click on the option to add, the basic option of the project will appear, in which we will fill in the subscription fields, resources to mention if you do not have this group, you can add them or add the existing ones
 It is important that the virtual machine has a name in this case I will put testmarvin as the name of the virtual machine. We have the possibility of adding the Virtual Machine region, it is important Azure us
 offers multiple images of operating systems in this case we will focus on installing a WIndow 10 home pro for educational purposes.
 As it is something basic we will use the most basic size of the virtual machine which can grow in size depending on our needs, Azure offers us additional disks, a public or private address to connect by RDP
 It is also important that we can connect by Password or a SHH for connections, depending on the virtual machines the cost is 0.0200 USD / hr an A0 machine.
