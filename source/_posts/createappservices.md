When selecting the Add option, it will show a new window where we will see the fields of the Web APP to be filled in, in this case we fill in the option of a group of resources where the app services will be if we do not have it, we will create it using testmarvin previously created.

It is important that you fill in the name because it is mandatory

Also, that we select the runtime stack where we want to run our app in this case, I will use Asp .net v4.7, the operating system will be Windows in this case, and the region for cost reasons (https://azure.microsoft.com / en-us / pricing / details / app-service / windows /) will use East US. We must also create an App Service Plan which will have the app services. The type of associated plan will use an F1 which is free for educational purposes, and when you have all the complete fields, we give you the option to review and create.
