Azure Lighthouse became generally available in July this year and we have seen a tremendous response from Azure managed service provider communities who are excited about the scale and precision of management that the Azure platform now enables with cross tenant management.

Great so what kind of resources does this work on?
As it is now it works for

Azure Automation
Azure Backup
Azure Kubernetes Service
Azure Monitor
Azure Policy
Azure Resource Graph
Azure Security Center
Azure Service Health
Azure Site Recovery
Azure Virtual Machines
Azure Virtual Network
This means that you can interact and use this services across. Now for instance Azure Web Apps is not supported but will still be a visible resource in the portal view so this should apply for all type of Azure Resource.
