  We must put a name to the storage account, in addition to them we must re-fill the data such as resources in this case I will use testmarvin, the name is indifferent you can put the one you want location I will use the east of the United States for latency, I will also use a Storage V2, the replication I will use is local you can do geographic replication depending on your needs
